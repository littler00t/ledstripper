WS2812 LED Strip Simulator for LUA-based Animations

Open the simulator in simulator/index.html and paste one of the animations from animations into it to see the animation.

Develop your own animations and use the simulator to test them without having to touch an actual strip.

Use the scripts in esp to run the scripts on an ESP8266 with an actual WS2812 attached directly to the ESP.
